        <p>First published in 1936, and now available in a centenary edition, this book was written by Nehru almost
            entirely in prison from June 1934 to February 1935. His account, though replete with autobiographical
            details, is much more than a personal document; in the words of Rabindranath Tagore, "Through all its
            details there runs a deep current of humanity which overpasses the tangles of facts and leads us to the
            person who is greater than his deeds, and truer than his surroundings." </p>
